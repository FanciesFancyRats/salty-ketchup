	<p class="four">A given commodity, e.g., a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking, y silk, or z gold, &c. – in short,<br> 
	for other commodities in the most different proportions. <span class ="four">Instead of one exchange value, <br>
	the wheat has, therefore, a great many. But since x blacking, y silk, or z gold &c., each represents the exchange <br>
	value of one quarter of wheat</span>, x blacking, y silk, z gold, &c., must, as exchange values, be replaceable by each other<br>
, or equal to each other. Therefore, first: the valid exchange values of a given commodity express something equal; secondly<br>
, exchange value, generally, is only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it, yet distinguishable from it.</p>
