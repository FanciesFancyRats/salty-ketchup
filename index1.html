				Just as, therefore, in viewing the coat and linen as values, we abstract from their different use values,<br /> 
				so it is with the labour represented by those values: we disregard the difference between its useful forms,<br /> 
				weaving and tailoring. As the use values, coat and linen, are combinations of special productive activities with cloth and yarn,<br/ >
				while the values, coat and linen,<br /> are, on the other hand, mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour,<br />
				so the labour embodied in these latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn,<br />
				but only as being expenditure of human labour power. Tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation of the use values, coat and linen, <br />
				precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different qualities;<br /> 
				but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities, only in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour,<br /> 
				do tailoring and weaving form the substance of the values of the same articles.
